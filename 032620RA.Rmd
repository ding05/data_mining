Problem 1

Part c

```{r}
X = matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5), ncol = 2)
Y = matrix(c(5, 9, 13), ncol = 1)
beta_hat = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% Y
beta_hat
```

```{r}
beta_hat = matrix(c(-7, 4), ncol = 1)
residuals_hat = Y - X %*% beta_hat
residuals_hat
```

In the outputs, “beta_hat” are the required ordinary least squares estimates of the coefficients, i.e. [-7 4]‘, and “residuals_hat” are the required estimates of the residuals, i.e. [0, 0, 0]’. We get the same estimated coefficients as that from the calculation by hand.

Part d

```{r}
X = matrix(c(3, 4, 5), ncol = 1)
Y = matrix(c(5, 9, 13), ncol = 1)
lm.fit = lm(Y ~ X)
lm.fit
```

In the outputs, “coefficients” are the required ordinary least squares estimates of the coefficients, i.e. [-7 4]’. We get the same estimated coefficients as that from the matrix calculation.
